The inspiration came from a series of tweets by Dan Qunitana about how to build an academic website using the blogdown package (Xie 2018). Following these instructions you can build a website for Bibi the Cat, using the Hugo academic theme but you can of course make a website for anything you like and use any of the many themes available. These instructions assume you have R (R Core Team 2018) and Rstudio installed and are reasonably comfortable using these tools. For much more detail check out the fantastic blogdown book.

JabRef is an open source bibliography reference manager. This is not the only way to do things, but it’s what I’m familiar with and is free. See the publications section for the full details. "],

This will then take you to the another screen where you can choose the directory for the website and we choose the theme. Given Bibi’s interests in rheology we’ll be using the hugo-academic theme, this is selected by entering gchusen/hugo-academic in the box as shown in Figure 2.2 Figure 2.2: Create a new directory with a suitable name with no spaces and choose a theme, here we’re using gchusen/hugo-academic.
