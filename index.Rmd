# Summary {-}

These are my instructions for how to build a website using R. The inspiration came from
a series of tweets by [Dan Qunitana](https://twitter.com/dsquintana) about how
to build an academic website using the [blogdown package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) [@R-bookdown].

Following these instructions you can build a website for Bibi the Cat, using 
the [Hugo academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) but you can of 
course make a website for anything you like and use any of the many themes 
available.

These instructions assume you have R [@R-base] and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed and are reasonably comfortable using these tools.

For much more detail check out the fantastic [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).
