# Automating deployment with GitHub

In [Chapter 2][Deployment] we used drag and drop of the public folder, 
but if you are familiar with version control (and if you aren't it's definitely 
worth learning), then you can automate deployment using [GitHub](https://github.com).

The details are in the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html), but essentially you 
can link netlify to your GitHub account and deploy to netlify from there. This 
means that anytime you update your site in Rstudio, you can push your files
to GitHub and your site will be deployed automatically.

Basically, this means you are tracking your changes and deploying in one step,
which is both quicker and means it's easy to revert should you need to.
