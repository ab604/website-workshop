# Getting started

## Installation

First you'll need to install the blogdown package:

```{r blogdown-install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("blogdown")
```

Then use blogdown to install the static site generator Hugo:

```{r hugo-install, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::install_hugo()
```

## Installing JabRef

If you are going to link academic publications on your website you will 
probably find it useful to have [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/) installed to 
create the necessary files you need.

JabRef is an open source bibliography reference manager.

This is not the only way to do things, but it's what I'm familiar with and is 
free.

See [the publications section][Creating publication files] for the full details.
